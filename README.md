 Some of the retailers such as FootLocker and West Gear sold out most products.Customers mostly bought the products using online platform which is followed by instore purchases. The profit margins were higher in the west and north eastern provinces. 

 Moving to the region of concern, a different startegy has to be applied  for marketing products using Amazon and Walmart ,which had the least sales and especially in the  southern provinces which had the lowest profit margin.
